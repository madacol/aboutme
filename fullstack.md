## Experience

### Escobedo Medina Auditores Asociados, Cajamarca, Perú  —  February 2019 - June 2020

  Accounting business that offers software for electronic invoicing.

  > **Software Developer: Frontend, Backend, Database, DevOps**

  **Tech Stack:** React, NodeJs / Express, Mysql, Docker, VB<span>.</span>NET and php

  Was hired to maintain a .NET invoicing system, and later developed a web-based ERP system.

- Replaced the lead programmer at the time and learned the Tech Stack in 3 months.
- Optimized a DB's stored procedure that took 7+ seconds, and reduced it to milliseconds by caching it.
- Automated the upgrading system of the .NET client to avoid manual upgrades by the support team.
- Implemented and helped design the new *web-based ERP system's* architecture and later dockerized it.
- Mentored other team members.
- Built an authentication system with role-based permissions.
- Developed several tests for a critical function that calculates the taxes and totals of an order


## Projects

### Webpipe (Web extension) — February 2022 - Current — [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8vP2M1B5UY&list=PLNb0YnM0RyKikrldCJ3hfWYxspbccqudE&index=1) — [Source](https://github.com/madacol/webpipe)

  A web extension that forwards the outputs of a webpage into inputs on another webpage. It's like a real-time copy-paster, but it gets powerful when [combined with a programmable webpage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doJV2TPVyxI&list=PLNb0YnM0RyKikrldCJ3hfWYxspbccqudE&index=4&t=62). The goal is to show how GUI interfaces could be made interoperable, similar to how Unix pipelines work

  **Tech Stack:** Firefox, Rollup, Svelte

### Taionca admin web — October 2020 - Current — [Source](https://github.com/madacol/taionca)

  A custom management software adapted to a remotely distributed team.

  **Tech Stack:** Svelte / Sapper, NodeJs, PostgreSQL\
  **Hosted in:** Google Cloud Platform, Fly.io

- Built an authentication system with role-based permissions
- Inventory management
- Tracking of expenses and virtual balances of bank accounts
- Automatic profit calculation and distribution on job completion
- Multi-currency system with automatic currency conversion

### Bolivar Paralelo — March 2018 - Current — [Web page](https://bolivarparalelo.com) — [Source](https://github.com/madacol/bolivarparalelo)

  An open-source web that analyzes <https://www.localbitcoins.com> offers and get currencies' rates to calculate cross rates and render history graphs. *Very useful in countries with foreign exchange controls like Argentina*

  **Tech Stack:** Svelte / Sapper, Nodejs, PostgreSql\
  **Hosted in:** Vercel, Google Cloud Platform

### Arduino controlled conveyor oven — January 2018 - Current — [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHU5xQRTyus) — [Source](https://github.com/madacol/ArduinoOven)

  A conveyor pizza oven automated using an arduino, with PID controlled temperature.

  **Tech Stack:** C++ / Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Bash, Python

<!-- - Designed, built and developed the electronic system around an *Arduino Mega* with a Touchscreen interface. -->
- Implemented PIDs to control temperature, using thermocouples for sensing, and servomotors controlling the gas valves as outputs
- Implemented another PID to control the conveyor’s speed (cook time), using a custom built encoder for sensing, and a DC motor regulated through a PWM signal as output.
- Attached a *Raspberry Pi Zero*  to the Arduino, to log data from the Serial port, serve a Web UI, and allow remote SSH connections to monitor the system and update the firmware.

### Helical Milling — 2013 — [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wu8dKf8xgoI) — [Source](https://github.com/madacol/helical-milling)

  This project allows a conventional horizontal milling machine to produce helical gears by rotating the chuck as the X axis advances

  **Tech Stack:** C / PIC16F877

<!-- - Designed, built and developed the electronic system. -->
- Used optical sensors to build an encoder that reads the trayectory in the X axis, and according to a previous configured number **`AnglesToRotate / StepsInX`** it rotates the piece to follow the desired helical angle\
  The Microcontroller receives the encoder's signal and proportionally rotates the piece through a stepper motor attached to the chuck.

### CNC router — 2009 - 2012 — [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiiE8h8b_Uk)

  A CNC router that cuts metal sheets up to 3 inches thick as drawn in a CAD file.
<!-- 
  Researched and implemented the software and electronic systems. -->

### Chess clock — 2010 — [Source](https://github.com/madacol/reloj-ajedrez)

**Tecks Stack:** Assembler / PIC16F84

### Bitcoin miners monitoring system — May 2015 - September 2016 — [Source](https://github.com/madacol/bitcoin-miners-monitor)

  Python scripts that ran in a Raspberry Pi to monitor bitcoin miners through LAN

  **Tech Stack:** Python, Bash, Raspberry Pi, Google Form, Google Sheets, exim4 (Linux mailer)

- Used cron jobs to run scripts periodically.
- Gathered data through cgminer's HTTP API.
- Uploaded data to Google Sheets through Google Forms.
- Notified by email any error encountered.
