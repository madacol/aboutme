## Experience

### Escobedo Medina Auditores Asociados, Cajamarca, Perú  —  February 2019 - June 2020

  Accounting business that offers software for electronic invoicing.

  > **Software Developer: Frontend, Backend, Database, DevOps**

  **Tech Stack:** React, NodeJs / Express, Mysql, Docker, VB<span>.</span>NET and php

  Was hired to maintain and develop a .NET invoicing system, and later started developing from scratch a web-based ERP system.

- Replaced the lead programmer at the time and learned the Tech Stack in 3 months. Had no previous experience with the languages VB<span>.</span>NET, SQL or php.
- Optimized a DB's stored procedure that took 7+ seconds after ~1 year of data, and reduced it to milliseconds by caching it.
- Implemented an automated upgrading system to avoid per-client manual upgrades by the support team, thus removed client's downtime, and semi-automated builds and deploys.
- Implemented and helped design the new *web-based ERP system's* architecture and later dockerized it.
- Built an authentication system with role-based permissions.
- Developed and heavily unit tested a critical function that calculates taxes and totals of an order, it is shared across the backend, frontend, and an electronic invoice manager.

## Projects

### Bolivar Paralelo — March 2018 - Current

  An open-source web that analyzes <https://www.localbitcoins.com> offers and get currencies' rates to calculate cross rates between them and render history graphs. *Very useful in countries with foreign exchange controls like Venezuela or Argentina*

  **Tech Stack:** Svelte / Sapper, Nodejs, PostgreSql\
  **Hosted in:** Vercel, Google Cloud Platform\

### ArduinoOven — January 2018 - Current

  A conveyor pizza oven automated using an arduino, with PID controlled temperature.

  **Tech Stack:** C++ / Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Bash, Python\
  [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHU5xQRTyus) — [Source](https://github.com/madacol/ArduinoOven)

- Designed, built and developed the electronic system around an *Arduino Mega* with a Touchscreen interface.
- Implemented software-based-PIDs to control temperatures and conveyor's speed (cook time).
- Attached a *Raspberry Pi Zero*  to the Arduino, to log data from the Serial port, serve a Web UI, and allow remote SSH connections to monitor the system and update the firmware.

### Bitcoin miners monitoring system — May 2015 - September 2016

  Python scripts that ran in a Raspberry Pi to monitor bitcoin miners through LAN

  **Tech Stack:** Python, Bash, Raspberry Pi, Google Form, Google Sheets, exim4 (Linux mailer)\
  [Source](https://github.com/madacol/bitcoin-miners-monitor)

- Used cron jobs to run scripts periodically.
- Gathered data through Miner's HTTP API.
- Uploaded data to Google Sheets through Google Forms.
- Notified by email any error encountered.

### Helical Milling — 2013

  Collection of electronic / mechanical devices that allows a conventional milling machine to produce helical gears.

  **Tech Stack:** C / PIC16F877\
  [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wu8dKf8xgoI) — [source](https://github.com/madacol/helical-milling)

- Designed, built and developed the electronic system.
- Used optical sensors to build an encoder that reads the trayectory in the X axis, and according to a previous configured number **`AnglesToRotate / StepsInX`** it rotates the piece to follow the desired helical angle\
  The encoder is read by the Microcontroller which moves a Stepper motor attached to the chuck that rotates the piece.

### CNC router — 2009 - 2012

  A CNC router that cut metal sheets up to 3 inches thick as drawn in a CAD file.

  [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joTXaflXwJw)

  Researched and implemented the software and electronic systems.
